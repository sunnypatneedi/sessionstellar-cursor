# Orchestration Quality Patterns

When working on complex tasks, follow these patterns to produce high-quality AI orchestration:

## Tool Diversity
- Use the right tool for each job — don't default to a single approach
- Prefer specialized tools (Glob, Grep, Read) over generic ones (Bash with grep/cat/find)
- Invoke multiple independent tool calls in parallel when possible

## Decision Depth
- When facing a choice between approaches, explicitly state the tradeoffs
- Document the chosen path and why alternatives were rejected
- Break complex decisions into smaller, reasoned steps

## Error Recovery
- When an error occurs, diagnose the root cause before retrying
- Try alternative approaches rather than repeating the same failed command
- Document what went wrong and how it was resolved

## Compound Learning
- Build on insights from earlier steps — don't re-discover the same information
- Reference previous findings when making new decisions
- Connect patterns across different parts of the codebase

## Agent Coordination
- Delegate research tasks to specialized agents when appropriate
- Run independent investigations in parallel
- Synthesize results from multiple sources before acting
